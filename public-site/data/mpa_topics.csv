Then just feel like shit the whole day and not eat anything else? Like full on panic mode after eating 2 bites.  I've been doing this on/off the past week. I feel super weird about it. Like I can't do one or the other. I can't eat because I feel like crap for not doing what I want to do and then I can't fast because I get hungry in the morning.  Ate a melba toast with a spoon of tuna today and then just went full panic.

Shitty, but i'll survive and do better tomorrow. But 100 cals on what was supposed to be a fasting day? End of the fucking world. Worst possible scenario. I can't do anything right. No one has ever been as weak and worthless as I am. Purge everything. Why? IDK...ed's man.  You certainly aren't alone, friend. Something thats helped me is replacing the idea of a fasting day, and replacing it with an OMAD day. I just tell myself that I'm allowed to eat today and its going to be fine and great when I do, I just have to wait for the set time for OMAD. Then I set the eating time for late in the day, like 8pm. Once 8pm rolls around, If I can keep fasting then i do. If I really can't, then its fine because I planed for an OMAD anyways and I just keep it small and manageable. Basically I just try to reverse psychology my brain into not feeling so deprived, while giving myself compassion if I do break the fast. Compassion is really important. When I do this I find 9 times out of 10, I'm able to do the complete fast with much less stress, anxiety or guilt.  Also make sure you're drinking water with electrolytes while you're fasting, not just water. This will help with cravings and make you feel much less like shit throughout the day, which REALLY ups the chances for success.

Not saying your going to die but anything under bmi 15 you can have a heart attack or go into cardiac arrest. Add the diuretics and laxatives with your purging those all 3 will mess up your electrolytes.

Here’s a few of mine, hopefully it’ll help someone who feels invalid for these! Iv struggled from anorexia on and off since 2015. So here’s a few..  - I love takeaways. Especially McDonald’s and kfc (easy to fit into your cal limit if you do OMAD 500-800cal)  - Iv only ever cried once over food within 7 years of my Ed (think it was mainly my period and hormones)  -I don’t have fear foods. If they fit into my calorie limit for the day then it’s fine! (Apart from oil, just unnecessary to me)  -I have never fainted, despite being underweight and low restriction  -I don’t think about food constantly, or let it consume me too much. (OMAD helps I think. When I used to fast I did but haven’t fasted since 2019)  -when in recovery periods, I find it relatively easy (like a switch in my mindset) however, I do tend to relapse a lot so  -I don’t excessively exercise (I like to try walk but that’s just so I stay active and productive)  -I have had my fair share of binge episodes in the past (due to fasting though which is why I stopped)  That’s all I can think of for now!

I get weird feelings sometimes and nothing ever happens.

Just dropped my intake. I tried to do the thing that you're ""supposed"" to do, and slowly lower it by a hundred calories a day, but that just made it worse for me. Stopped buying easy food. Personally, I am terrified of cooking for non-ED reasons, so if I have to actually make food, I will put it off for as long as I can. It also makes it harder to binge if you have to wait twenty minutes for the food to cook. Drink LOTS. Not only can liquid give you that feeling of fullness, but sometimes I'm just after a flavor, so drinking soda or flavored water helps. Stay away from food. Obviously, you might need to walk through your kitchen at some point, so it can't be avoided entirely. Just make an effort to be otherwise occupied if you know that there may be a situation where you would be offered food. Something I've noticed on this site is that there is no one-size-fits-all situation. You kinda gotta mess around and see what works for you.

But honestly? I ate 'normally' for 3-4 weeks before my body calmed down and I could restrict again. I've noticed it in my thoughts too, it's not all or nothing mentality anymore, and food is 'just food' right now, and I can effortlessly restrict again.  So what I did was eat at TDEE or even above (yes weight gain happened, but mostly because of the binges, eating slightly above TDEE barely made me gain anything significant) for a few weeks straight, also because I was on holiday and gave less importance to food.  I dread to think what would have happened had I continued trying to restrict, maybe I'd be piling on the kilos to this day and forever gaining weight. But as said above, there is no one size fits all with binge cycle recovery, it really depends on your body and mind, unfortunately.  For me one big thing was that my brain was being signalled that 'food is scarce! eat more!' because I kept trying to restrict and count calories. Yes I stopped counting for a few weeks, just kind of eyeballing things.

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,Sooo BLOATED (with pics),1,hollowthatfollows,2022-10-20 15:57:49-04:00,"I was bloated for several years until a doctor suggested that I may be eating something that I'm no longer able to digest well. to be fair, I was also experiencing a lot of nausea, especially in the mornings most of the time after eating I would feel my stomach turning so much I would have to puke. I wasn't purging on purpose it would just happen and i was miserable from puking everyday for years. My doctor suggested I cut gluten out of my diet to see how i felt. After 6 weeks of really avoiding gluten at all costs, i lost 2 pants sizes from the debloat alone. I stopped puking everyday and now when i eat gluten i get symptoms very similar to lactose intolerance. Turns out I had been extremely stressed and not eating well and it caused me to develop a gluten intolerance somehow, its still up in the air how i got it but that's the only explanation I have been able to get.  It's very possible something you are eating is causing your bloat. If ur not puking all the time like i was, its very possible has more to do with a high FODMAP food or foods in your diet causing you to have trouble digesting. You could try a low fodmap diet where you slowly introduce higher fodmap foods one by one until you find the culprits to get rid of your chronic bloat hopefully.

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,Sooo BLOATED (with pics),1,xXHahahaXx,2022-10-20 15:57:49-04:00,"hollowthatfollows said: I was bloated for several years until a doctor suggested that I may be eating something that I'm no longer able to digest well. to be fair, I was also experiencing a lot of nausea, especially in the mornings most of the time after eating I would feel my stomach turning so much I would have to puke. I wasn't purging on purpose it would just happen and i was miserable from puking everyday for years. My doctor suggested I cut gluten out of my diet to see how i felt. After 6 weeks of really avoiding gluten at all costs, i lost 2 pants sizes from the debloat alone. I stopped puking everyday and now when i eat gluten i get symptoms very similar to lactose intolerance. Turns out I had been extremely stressed and not eating well and it caused me to develop a gluten intolerance somehow, its still up in the air how i got it but that's the only explanation I have been able to get.  It's very possible something you are eating is causing your bloat. If ur not puking all the time like i was, its very possible has more to do with a high FODMAP food or foods in your diet causing you to have trouble digesting. You could try a low fodmap diet where you slowly introduce higher fodmap foods one by one until you find the culprits to get rid of your chronic bloat hopefully.

It was fairly sustainable though and lived likefor approx a year and a half without too many issues.  However, I’ve also done OMAD and just saved my calories for the end of the day. If you don’t struggle with low blood sugar, or extreme exhaustion/brain fog, OMAD is nice because you don’t really need to think about food all day. Food basically doesn’t exist until nighttime (in theory). And then you can have a giant ass normal-type meal (and feel full if you’re in to that - I know I am) and still be within your calorie goals.

This is from ""The Famished Spirit"". Nearly ten years later I still really like looking at these, sad as it is. If you like manga I think this is a good series. It has comedic moments and dramatic moments. You can easily read it online. This story in particular is not super focused on this character's anorexia but it is brought up as an important part of her struggles. It's actually interesting and not a basic stereotypical ""ana"" character.

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,High res best suits me and it doesn’t make me any less disordered,1,Halfdeadkitty,2022-10-20 20:30:55-04:00,"I am currently 5’7 and weigh 113 pounds which puts me at BMI 17.7… don’t get me wrong any type of restriction is taxing on your body but high res has made it so much easier to be consistent with weight loss and prevents binges. I usually eat 1200-1500 calories every day and I burn about 300-500 calories doing cardio in the gym. When doing low res I could barely work out cause I was so weak and my heart was so stressed… and the beauty of working out and burning calories is being able to eat good foods without feeling guilty. I’ve been conditioned to fear high res and the idea made me feel less valid but im pretty underweight and my goal is to weigh 105 pounds which I know is possible while doing high res. Low res also make you lose muscle a lot more quicker and you will be more prone to becoming skinny fat… with the more energy and protein u get from high res the better results u will see at the gym. Skinny fat isn’t flattering in my opinion but to each their own. Another benefit of high res is being able to poop, whats the point of low res when you retain water weight and poop weight cause u can’t poop. I know not everyone feels comfortable doing high res but in my personal experience I wish I would have done it sooner because I’m pretty sure I would have been at my UGW months ago.",FALSE,0,0.007358397,0.002016777,0.002185049,0.35471225,0.0815836,0.06251823,0.31859085,0.027037935,0.001631821,0.14236511,mpa

I don't dream every night maybe 1 or 2 times a week, but when I do it's usually very VIVID dreams. The most common dream I get is about losing/chipping my teeth. My first thoughts in the dream are always something along the lines of ""My father is going to kill me for this."" The 2nd most common dream I get is about snakes biting me although I am not scared of snakes at all when conscious.  When I was a child I would have the same dreams about losing teeth and snakes but I also had a lot of horror movies like nightmares about zombies and apocalypses. I always HATED them and I would wake up in the middle of the night with my heart beating out of my chest, feeling like I was right about to die. I would have to sit there and convince myself that it was just a dream and zombies are not real because I would be so disoriented and upset when waking up. I do occasionally get these dreams still but they are a lot less common than before.  I am greek and my father was always VERY suspicious about dreams and Greeks believe that dreams tell your future. Teeth falling out is a really bad omen that something really bad is going to happen to you and snakes represent people that deceive you and appear to be a friend when they really aren't. I haven't decided if i think that's true or not because I had so many dreams like that over my life. I'll leave a link to a greek dream dictionary if anyone wants to check it out.

I do fast sometimes but rarely, my most was like 44h. For my binges i plan them, every friday (most of the time) i have one and i eat basically everything i want (2000 ~3500 cals) and i don’t feel extremely bad after i have them, like yeah a bit disappointed but not for like more than a couple hours, and it’s not even intense. This month is my birthday month and halloween so i had like 3 days where i eated a lot on top of the other day of binge i had, plus 2 days of binge soon for halloween because of friends so i counted how much day i would have binge this month and its like 10 days out of 31 and it made me stress but i feel like others stress more than me. does this makes me invalid? am i atypical? or ednos? or just faking?  also i had planned a binge for sunday but tomorrow is my friend birthday and i really wanted to go so i said “fuck it we’re gonna have 2 binge day and just cancel the one from next week”. but usually anorexic people or anyone with ed would just not go see their friends or try not to, they wouldn’t do that do i don’t know what i am because i still want to enjoy times with my friends.",FALSE,0,0.000961638,0.13107339,0.001659375,0.001039808,0.08046238,0.001212811,0.35298082,0.011280227,0.20480493,0.2145246,mpa

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,glimpse of in-patient - is it really THIS depressing?,1,jane.margolis,2022-10-26 11:59:13-04:00,"Okay, so today I experienced something that gave me food (🙄) for thought.  Long story short, I have a lawsuit in process regarding medical mistake that has been made during my gallbladder removal surgery. So I got myself a lawyer and claimed compensation. This accident worsened my already severe depression, and so I had to be examined by the forensic psychiatrist. At the biggest mental facility in my country. Today.  Holy shit, it was like a horror movie. Picture this: you're driving in the outskirts, gloomy morning at 9AM. A long driveway leads you to the gate as you pass utility buildings, made of red bricks characteristic for II WW buildings in central Europe. You can barely see the grass, covered with golden leaves fallen from surrounding trees that make a small forest around the complex. You're told to leave the car at the gate, so the rest you walk on foot. You'd call it less of a complex and more of an agglomeration, having its very own park with a couple of rusty benches and a random volleyball net. Each hospital ward has its very own red-bricked building. My visit was scheduled on ward 23rd, I have no idea how many of them are there all together.  Silence. Sense of isolation, like the outside world could have been as well all made up. Time slowed down and I felt like I was in another dimension. Wandered around the complex waiting for the visit. How do people ever get well in such a place? As I leave the room afterwards, some lunatics decided to sit by the door and block it. They do listen to the psychiatrist accompanying me, but they don't look in the eye. I know the emptiness and the sadness as I carry it in me. So I allow myself to call them lunatics in my head, as I'm one of them.  I pass a group of teenagers having a walk in the park, accompanied by the hospital staff. I felt like my chest is suddenly 100 pounds heavier, like someone grabbed me by the throat. Again, how do people get well here? If I've gotten there, I would have forgotten how to function, embracing the isolation that felt more imprisoning that heavy locks on even heavier doors.  Sorry for being so poetic and dramatic, I just can't get over today and this is the only palce I have to vent.  I often say to myself ""I'm not sick enough"" or some Tumblr-cringy stuff like ""I wanna be the thinniest b*itch out there"". But that place seriously creeped the shit out of me, they could have filmed Grave Encounters there. I kept thinking ""I don't ever wanna end up here"". But these thoughts faded away a couple of hours later when I anxiously noticed I already ate 800cals at 2PM, and usually it's around 300cals at that time when I'm at work.  So, my question at the very end of this not so captivating story would be:  Is in-patient really like that? Crushing your chest, sucking out your soul, saturating your sadness and darkness?

With regard to other misuse of this site: I have suffered from AN for 23 years now. I have been to long term treatment and I've relapsed as well. From treatment to my own journey, I've seen the ugliest of the ugly when it comes to Anas. Lately I have been noticing that a lot of posts have inaccuracies and sometimes, near impossibilities. Outside of aforementioned predators, I'm not really sure what someone would gain by pretending to be Anorexic or having AN, but if you fall into that category, shame on you for entering this space. You aren't wanted here and you should leave. This is not a dieting forum or a place for you to learn weight loss tips. The individuals who are on this site, are because they need a safe space, and have an illness that beats them down daily. So yeah, it's a pretty big insult to see some of these fake posters. And, by the way, these phony posts and replies, they're really obvious.  I have edited in bolded, underlined, italics to reflect the edits. I think there were good points made, some misunderstandings, some gentle suggestions and overall a conversation. Because that's what this is about, conversation, community, and feeling safe in this space.",FALSE,37,0.021343803,0.001679192,0.25036553,0.036646623,0.42806584,0.001329696,0.001499139,0.098597676,0.05715476,0.10331775,mpa

I’m never hungry. I don’t want to eat. I’m trying to force myself to eat but everytime I eat I feel guilty. I don’t know what to do. I’ve recently lost more weight and now I’m at like 86 pounds, 5’4. If my mom weighs me (which she probably will soon) and sees that number she will freak the fuck out. I don’t want to waterload though because everytime I get extremely bloated and it makes me dizzy. What should I do? Click to expand... I'm so glad you realize you can't afford to damage your body, it's a very insightful mature thing to know because you will save your self a tonne load of health consequences. I developed oteoperosis at 18 and had heart failure as well as actual multi organ failure, it happens at all ages, your bones & brain are still developing its a critical time for nutrition.  I would say are there any foods you like which may make eating easier? Your hunger cues will eventually come back which may help, maybe remind yourself of why you need to... Because ip isn't fun as it can damage your want to recover as your control is taken away and the amount you have to eat can feel like to much mentally...

This is my advice, which would work at ERC, but I’m not sure about other PHPs. 1. Hide food. If you’re good at slight of hand, get that shit in your pockets and sleeves. If you have milk with a meal, boost for the meal with vanilla boost and you may be able to pour some into your milk. 2. Purge. We had unmonitored bathrooms after meals in PHP. Just make sure no one can hear you. 3. Take advantage of the night. Skip nighttime snack. Exercise in the evenings. You can get away with just about anything when you’re in your own apartment. 4. Water load/stuff your underwear for weights. If you can, secretly buy a scale and measure how much you have to load/stuff to make it look like you’re maintaining your weight. 5. Don’t get caught. DO NOT GET CAUGHT. They can and will send you back to res if they catch you not complying with meals and losing weight.

I have been in love with glucomannan powder since a few months, I'm trying to lose 2-3 kg to gain my goal weight and it looks like glucomannan (VERY SLOWLY) helps me with it. I eat it a few times a day (overdosing probably) as an ingredient of a 'pudding', consisting of water, sweetener, salt and 50 g of milk. It tastes well and it prevents me from binging and bulimic episodes which I used to have a few times a month previously. However, I don't know how I should count the glucomannan thing in my calorie calculations. Found much different info on the web - my fitness pal states that the flour has 129 kcal / 100 g, some other sources opt for something around 300 kcal / 100 g, and some different sources say that it doesn't matter anyway as the fiber isn't actually digested and doesn't have any caloric effect. With glucomannan pudding being served a few times a day I manage to keep my daily calory intake on a decent level of 1000 - 1100 kcal without binging / bulimic episodes, and without it I used to binge despite of eating about 1400 calories per day.

I call myself somewhat recovered because I want to lose my recovery weight again to a point that’s far from my natural set weight but, I’d definitely not go lower than normal weight anymore. Also, after 23y of ED, I have this internalized knowledge that (very) low restriction and ignoring my health will never do the trick (of making me happy) in the long term. And I have also understood that a boney look (BMI 15 and lower) will neither. I have experienced it so many times and you can read it on here too, it’s not sustainable. So I found myself a goal that will be sustainable for me:  —> BMI 18.0 weight (a range between 17.5 and 18.5 is acceptable for me and if I reach any of the 2 thresholds, I will do something about it to get back to BMI 18.0 again)  —> allow myself always between 1080 and 1250 calories  —>allow myself to participate in family / friends gatherings (luckily they‘re limited to like once every two months, monthly at the max)  I never eat uncontrollably or „binge“. However, I still call myself somewhat Anorexic because I eat too little and exercise too mich for my height (5‘6 / 170cm) and I want to be skinny so much that I ignore my body‘s needs.  besides, I have a loving relationship with a beautiful soul, I have a great and well paying job in tech, I am totally independent and saving money every month and I have dreams to pursue.

Really? My anorexia has made me do some fucked up things but I never wished death on anyone but myself. And I'm sorry but you can't blame your brother for your ed. Parents, maybe. But your brother? He's not forcing you to be competitive. You could try to walk away from this, but you choose to constantly try to compete with him.

I've been gaining weight from low calorie amounts (300-500kcal) every day since Friday. Yesterday, I lowered my intake and consumed exactly 237kcal but I gained even more weight than before! In addition, I took 10k steps, twice the amount I usually take. I even reduced my water intake to 400ml a day (that's the amount of water I was drinking when I was losing weight rapidly), but this time it didn't work out AT ALL. I had no bowel movement since Saturday but my stomach doesn't look bloated. Where does my body even store all that food? I feel like my whole body is swollen. Especially my fingers and toes have become visibly fat and bending them feels weird. My wrist and my ankles are also swollen but what's even worse is that my face has gotten fatter, too (especially in the area around my eyes). Whenever I take off my clothes, its traces are visible on my reddish skin. All in one, I believe that my body might be retaining water and this is genuinely disgusting. Before Friday, I used to lose 200-300g a day while eating less than 150kcal and drinking no more than 400ml of water. Then I increased my intake to 300-500kcal and 600ml of water which ruined everything for me. What shall I do? I am so desperate and I'm starting to consider suicide.

If their causing you that much stress you can distance yourself from them. Yes it's family but some family is toxic and not good for anyone. If you can't do that you need to find another way to deal with stress besides eating. A hobby, music, tv, walking, yoga, meditation. This site is probably adding extra stress to be perfect or lose weight and causing you more binges. Not saying go away from it completely but if it's not helping try something different. If music doesn't work with me I either go for a ride, the park, or strangely enough watch crime shows.

She put me on the spot, she was like I saw a picture of you and it didn't look good, I can see your bones now you didn't used to look like this. So then we started talking about it and she was really nice. THEN a few days ago I saw her again and she was like 'I didn't eat anything today', or a other time she told me I should eat before a party we were going to and that she had to leave the call because she was going to have dinner then at the party she said she didn't end up eating anything. I don't know if it's me but that was so triggering and also felt mean? idk? I just told her about it, she knows the struggle and then does things like that? idk made me wonder what's triggering for other people? So tell me your triggers if you feel comfortable. That sounds like something my friend would do as well. She has struggled with ED and gets triggered quite easily. I never ever talk about anything ED or weight loss related with her because I don't want her to get triggered or worried. However our other friends (who don't have ED) sometimes talk about eating in a somewhat triggering way (for example things like ""I haven't eaten anything today"", ""I forgot to eat dinner""). Then my friend starts telling that she ""has also forgot to eat"" or ""has only eaten one piece of fruit today"", things like that. I think many people with ED feel the need to be ""better"" than others by eating less, and some even need to state it out loud to calm themselves down or something.  When it comes to my triggers, I might get triggered if my boyfriend eats less than me. He's quite skinny and doesn't have a big appetite due to being very sedentary. He spends most of his time at home playing videogames or studying. However, what others eat don't bother me that much. How they look and how much they weight is much more ""important"" to my ED brain. For example this one girl from my college is the same exact height as me but weights like 20 lbs less and is much prettier. I also have other very skinny friends and that triggers the hell out of me.",TRUE,0,0.00805356,0.17629647,0.001308308,0.004467506,0.0889731,0.030137708,0.004725759,0.19127801,0.39857483,0.09618483,mpa

I stumble out of my room down the stairs to the kitchen. Everyone is asleep, so I take the pair of scissors from the kitchen draw and hobble back upstairs. The blade is cold in my hand: this is the pair I always used to use. I walk over to my paint-splattered desk and grab a sharpie, and then head to the bathroom. I pause for a moments; I stare at the orange handle of the scissors, knowing the blades are faintly stained with my blood. It will be just like old times, I suppose. I tear the cap off of the sharpie and let the intoxicating stench fill my lungs: maybe I could get high too, I think, but I proceed with my task. I hold my arm out to the side, and in the reflection I watch as the congealing fat jiggles on it like some kind of rotting jelly. I hate it so much. I mark my arm with the sharpie, drawing a dotted line on both sides of my upper arm, connecting at the elbow. I can hear my own breathing, fast and shallow; my heart pounded in my chest. I make the same marks on my other arm, but I’m drawing with my left hand and they’re wobbly. I don’t have much time. They’ll have to do. I raise the scissors to my armpit, and gather the fat in their teeth. I force my brain to repeat ‘thinner is the winner’ as I make the first cut.The flesh is thick and tough to cut through, and I bite down on cotton wool to prevent myself from crying in agony. Eventually the blade goes through. FUCK. Tears blur my vision and blood leaks out. No you can’t stop. Again. I cut and cut and cut until I’m covered in blood. Their is a satisfying squelching noise when the bloodied fat hits the floor, like a snake . I pick it up. It feels slimy in my hands and I drop it in disgust. I raise the scissors to my other arm. Cut, cut, cut. It takes longer this time, as I’m using my left hand, and is somehow even more painful. I nearly fall to the floor, blinded by the pain, but I get through it.. the other roll of fat dropped to the floor,which is now covered in my blood. I feel dissy. I stumble to my bed and wrap my arms as tight as I could with towels to try to stop the bleeding, but it doesn’t work. The world starts to fade away. NO.nonononono no, I don’t wanna die. I muster all my strength and make my way upstairs to myparents room. I’m panting, and the room is spinning as I push open their door. I black out on their bed, to the sound of my mums screaming.

I had lost 45% of my body weight in 7 months, but I was still just above the cut off for anorexia (by .1) of a bmi mark. My psychiatrist at the time told me she was very concerned because of how much and because of the time frame and wanted to send me off to hospital (I refused) and she said the nhs wouldn’t take me anyway (they only care if your bmi is like 12 and you’re on the brink of death) because I didn’t fulfill the criteria.  The psychiatrist told me I would need to recover on my own at home.

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,Atypical?,1,Wingy,2022-10-30 05:02:12-04:00,"Having a bad relationship with food is damaging no matter your size. My restricting originally started and went off/on while I was clinically obese. Everything has been ""fine and dandy"" as none of my organs have been damaged yet, but I'm terrified of what I will do once I reach my ultimate goal weight, because there is a point where you have to stop- and that's near impossible for some people. No matter what weight you start at, you eventually will get to a point where it becomes physically damaging, and it will be incredibly dangerous to keep going.  While I was obese, my family and friends and people who knew me supported my eating habits, and encouraged me to keep going, all because I was (actually) fat. When you are overweight, people reward you for any attempt to lose it, even if it is considered dangerous, from my experience. Even my doctors have told me in the past that what I was doing was ""working"", if I came in with an insane amount of weightloss since the last visit. Nobody recognizes that your eating is disordered or damaging until you ""look anorexic"" or suffer bodily damage from your eating habits.  I think that it would be a good idea for you to bring up your concerns around eating to a therapist if this is a concern for you. It is a dangerous mental illness, no matter how long it takes for it to negatively effect your body. The effects will likely carry on past your healthy BMI if it is not addressed, which is even more dangerous. I assume, like most mental illness, the longer they are left untreated, the worse it gets.  Seeing as you are having genuine problems with food, I would say it is concerning. If you are afraid of getting shot down by your therapist, you could voice the possibility of ""BED"" because many therapists will brush off anyone who doesn't fit the weight criteria for AN, including atypicals. The restriction/starvation would still be addressed either way. Anything that it takes to get someone to help you.  The biggest issue is addressing the mental aspect. This applies to anyone with any type of AN, really. A lot of therapists and hospitals just have the goal of getting you back to a healthy weight (""fattening you up"", as some here have said) and barely touch the source of the problem, leading them to go back down the rabbit hole as soon as they get out.  Wow I typed a lot. I just resonate with this issue quite a bit. Infact, a big part of my restriction was wanting to be validated, alongside the primary issues that triggered it. There had been times I considered recovering, but I would always decide against it because I knew that I would be brushed off, and that I wasn't ""anorexic enough"". I didn't even reach out to this website until I felt ""valid"", because I knew I would be met with hostility, just like you have been in this comment section a bit.  So, in short, you do have a problem, and it needs to be addressed. Your weight just buys you more time to address it. But you can still lose weight healthily, so I would suggest addressing your issue and finding a healthy lifestyle, rather that letting your issues with eating consume you.",FALSE,0,0.003881949,0.001063958,0.03007802,0.14534877,0.40621278,0.007270354,0.000949874,0.068900615,0.0201444,0.31614932,mpa

My therapist already knows I have B/P'd, and that i'm not ready to talk about that. I honestly think it will be pressed more if I continue losing the way I am. I dont know why admitting I restrict is harder when I'm totally ashamed of purges. Maybe at one point I might.... but the body-shame of not fitting the mould is one of the things that holds me back. (The other being I do want to lose more weight)  I think atypical is kinda a sensitive issue. And I'm really glad people have related (though for your ownselves I wish you didnt!). I know the term tends to get bounded around and probably misused by some. Obviously the Tess Holiday thing... I obviously dont know her personally or know if her issues are real or not, but the way shes portayed as a joke and attention seeker makes her someone you never want to be compared to. :/",FALSE,0,0.001403035,0.008984669,0.0766719,0.021767318,0.29289705,0.028769812,0.001994985,0.21896026,0.18406016,0.1644908,mpa

It doesn't contain a definite answer, it's just a experience.  I got diagnosed with anorexia around 3 years ago. I didn't really believe I had it myself at the time. However, I had been starving myself and struggled a lot with eating enough. After participating in a intensive day program and being tired of suffering and feeling miserable I eventually gave recovery a shot. I'm gonna be honest. It was tough. It was a progress of ups and downs, from slowly getting better to wanting to give up again to stopping following my mealplan because I believed it contained too much food to being happy about not freezing as much anymore. It was a mess. I had, however, regular checkups with my nurse and the regular meetings gave me the strength I needed to keep going.  I was outpatient as an eating disorder patient for about 1,5 years there. I slowly did start to feel better. Especially in the end of my treatment period, I was usually positive during my appointments. I stayed at a borderline underweight for some time, and then slowly started gaining. I don't consider myself anorexic anymore, I guess you could call me recovered. I want to emphasize the fact that it took me a couple of years to start to feel fully recovered. It's no fast journey.  I do still struggle a bit with food tho. Especially recently I've been gaining a lot of weight which has brought me back here. I have had problems with binge eating and am trying to get down to a lower end normal weight. The difference this time is I don't want to be underweight, rather healthy.

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,No one noticing Weight Loss. & Body Dysmorphia rant,1,Goldilocks&The3EDs,2022-10-27 07:26:19-04:00,"Overall message : because I have really bad body dysmorphia, I can never judge my own perceptions as being true, and what I see morphs every time I look. So now when I think i've lost weight, and no one else notices, it invalidates my reality...  LONG : (TLDR at bottom) between Nov 2021 - Jan 22 i very obviously had a breakdown, lost a ton of weight very quickly. on top of losing weight steadily through the rest of the year. as a result, I was undeniably tiny.  I then... 'recovered.' (not at all, just developed BED / briefly bulimia after low restricting/fasting for so long and piled on soooo much weight.) from April - September. I was weight restored but my mind was sicker than it had ever been, let's be real. It was only at this point I actually realised how thin I had got before... which made my weight gain even more devastating. I was also on some pretty strong anti-psych meds which made me gain weight.  & now (Sept - Present Day) I'm in 'relapse', and i've been eating between 800 - 1000 calories a day on average for around 2 months, with some unavoidable maintenance days in-between with family/friend visits etc. This is thanks to my new ADHD medication which really helps with appetite suppressing, as well as a stressful job that keeps me distracted most of the day.  When i originally lost all the weight and my friends & fam saw me, they were truly horrified. I loved seeing their expressions of shock (I know thats fucked up) and they did not hold back on the comments about it. Then when I 'recovered' they all commented on that too. 'oh you look so much healthier!' 'look at that bum!', ' so glad you don't seem to be having a problem eating' etc. yeah, gut punching.  The body dysmorphia carried into my weight gain too. for a while I was oblivious to it, then suddenly one day none of my clothes fit. My friends and family said the weight gain 'isn't noticeable, don't worry' (LIES) which only lead to more confusion about my true size as I cant trust my own eyes. I even convinced myself that my clothes suddenly not fitting meant that my new washing machine was shrinking all my clothes, that was the only reason. yeah... right. Now I look back at those times (April -August) in absolute disgust, I can't believe I was so fat!! and all my family/friends lied to me saying I looked great!!!  I live in a different city to my closest friends/family, so I only see them maybe once every 6ish weeks. My friend came 2 weeks ago. I thought i'd lost a decent amount of weight, and I was ready for the 'you've lost weight' comments. but she didn't say a thing. this really confused me. Same thing last time my mum came down a few weeks before that. I was expecting her to worry... she didn't even notice, not a word said about it. Now if my mum compliments me, it just reinforces the fact I look fat. since when I was thin, she'd only ever insult me and say I looked 'horrible'.  this just fuels the fire of my Body dysmorphia, and makes me feel like i'm not making any progress & its all in my head. but i'm also too much of a wuss to weigh myself and measure myself because I know it will throw my mental health off so much... and Im a Corporate girlie so I don't have time for a breakdown lmfao.  The only positive I have here, is a blue dress. A dress I bought on holiday with my abusive ex nearly exactly 1 year ago. it fit me like a glove at the time, like it had been tailored to me. I tried it on again this summer, and it wouldn't even fasten half way, my armpit fat was spilling over the sides, it was so bad. I thought i might as well throw it away as there was no hope id ever get it on again. Cut to last week, I tried it on, it fit. it zipped all the way up. It was a little tight on my arms, so I thought ok i'm not going to see this as a win until it feels truly comfortable on again. tried it on last night. it fits, if anything, its now got roomie in the armpit area... and Im going to wear it on friday for halloween.  i'm going to call this the 'blue dress test' so WHY can I clearly see that i AM making progress, but when i'm naked, I still see a fat mess? when i'm sitting, I still feel the fat of my stomach the same as 3 months ago... my mind even goes 'well you've clearly stretched the dress out. thats the only reason it fits now' (which isn't true, I know it isnt really...)  I feel insane, and i'm losing motivation to keep restricting. should I just continue as I am doing, high restriction, hoping eventually I lose enough that anyone will care? the aim is to get back down to what I was just before Christmas '21 (not my lowest, still tiny - but less haunted looking lmao) and Its just not happening fast enough... if at all... god i'm so confused. should I cut the calories more??  TLDR : I have body dysmorphia and never trust what I see. I am too afraid to measure myself, weigh myself. The only way I can judge progress is being made is by trying on my 'sick' clothes, which are gradually starting to fit again. slowly. Don't see closest fam/friends often, but then I do, no one is commenting on my weight anymore. So since I never know what I look like, I cant tell if the weight loss is all in my head, and Im not actually having any progress...  does anyone else feel like this ever? any advice or just want to moan with me?",FALSE,0,0.000346918,0.053961847,0.054007947,0.030417858,0.11247944,0.11893945,0.10898095,0.07416915,0.12896323,0.31773323,mpa

Also they probably think it's full of young teenage girls mostly even though here are so many people 40+ and men too. They don't get that we can actually talk to each other about our EDs to cope and feel less alone in our struggles. That we can actually find friends here and that we literally share harm reduction tips on here and encourage each other to get better and to recover because we know how horrible EDs are so why would we want other people to suffer too? It's literally a substitute for therapy for some people who can't access therapy IRL.

The body can only take so much. There's nothing you can do apart from have some type of food or nutritional drink..more water perhaps for hydration? Low restriction is more effective then fasting because your totally messing up your metabolism, so when you do eat, you will gain weight much quicker. This and also the caffeine's not going to work keeping you awake since you purged. So basically you drank it for no effect.

It really depends on how often you see each other. I usually see my boyfriend for an evening with a sleepover so that’s dinner, breakfast maybe lunch. He knows about my ED, but he thinks I’m doing wayyyyy better than I am. So the way I manage is on the dinner day not eat and then when I go for dinner there are now calories on the menu so I pick something in the middle (all the options are always more than I’d allow myself daily) I pick something in the middle because of him thinking I’m doing well. So I pick something I like the sound of. If we get dessert I get something too but maybe only eat half. (On this day I probably end up eating around 1500 cals and I usually have 500)  Then breakfast we usually get a baked thing like a croissant. Then to compensate I usually wouldn’t eat after he’s left and do more exercise. If he stays for lunch the same as if he wouldn’t and then restrict more the next day and more exercise.

Then eventually I got better, lost a significant amount of weight and was very underweight. However, I was in the best mental shape of my life. I did not struggle with eating and allowed myself everything in moderation. I was very relaxed around food and exercise and I was doing very good! However, as already mentioned, everybody thought that I'm struggling heavily and gaslighted me into thinking that I have a problem, whereas in reality I knew that I am doing better.

But from a smart brain, to lose weight and keep it off:  BMR=Low Between BMR and TDEE=middle to high, depends how active you are  If your TDEE is 2000, your BMR 1400, that I would say up tp 1700 is middle and over is high.  I have tried everything over the decades and high res with 1-300 cals deficit is the best, takes longer, but you suffer less mentally and physically and if you can handle a weight in the higher underweight range or lower healthy range, I would go with that.  You can go down to 13, 14, 15 and you will die or gain it back anyways.

Like when I was 18-20 I wasn´t able to eat at all, because of this deep fear inside of me. So I lived of glucose tabs and broth.

I used to higher restrict (900ish calories and no movement) and then would have a cheat day once every 4-5 weeks, and I would be able to maintain that for like 5 months, but then something would hit and I'd fall off the wagon. This happened twice, and both times I'd gain a lot of weight and get closer to my starting weight. Super terrible, and since I was sedentary and higher restricting anyways, I lose weight super slow imo.  Now, what I do is mid-low restrict (600-800 calories) plus walking, and I seem to lose weight faster, but I also end up eating maintenance/going off track more frequently. But where I thought this would lead to tremendous weight gain, it hasn't so far. I had a 10 day period of eating regularly/eating out, and I think I did gain a little weight, it fell off faster. Not really sure if this makes sense, but what I'm saying is that frequent maintenance days (like 1 every 2 weeks or when you have an unbeatable craving) have made my extreme hunger less and made it easier to restrict long term because my body isn't slowly delving deeeeep into fatigue, but I'm keeping myself on my toes by low restricting for like 2 weeks then eating normally.

I don't eat at all throughout the day, the only thing I consume is coffee, lots and lots of iced coffee- of course with low fat milk.

But it's also kind off motivation for me to fast  ""I knew I was pregnant because my breasts looked better than they had ever looked. I’m very aware of my body, what goes into it, how to nourish it, how to keep it toned. Growing up watching my mother’s waistline expand with her laziness, I work out daily, sometimes twice a day. I learned very early on that a human is not merely comprised of only one thing. We are two parts that make up the whole. We have our conscious, which includes our mind, our soul, and all the intangible parts. And we have our physical being, which is the machine that our conscious relies on for survival. If you fuck with the machine, you will die. If you neglect the machine, you will die. If you assume your conscious can outlive the machine, you will die shortly after learning you were wrong. It’s very simple, really. Take care of your physical being. Feed it what it needs, not what the conscience tells you it wants. Giving in to cravings of the mind that ultimately hurt the body is like a weak parent giving in to her child. “Oh, you had a bad day? Do you want an entire box of cookies? Okay, sweetie. Eat it. And drink this soda while you’re at it.” Caring for your body is no different from caring for a child. Sometimes it’s hard, sometimes it sucks, sometimes you just want to give in, but if you do, you’ll pay for the consequences eighteen years down the road. It’s fitting when it comes to my mother. She cared for me like she cared for her body. Very little. Sometimes I wonder if she’s still fat—if she’s still neglecting that machine.""",FALSE,8,0.032994803,0.02833456,0.01253634,0.043714624,0.3422422,0.027968347,0.054720942,0.19366926,0.21402402,0.049794868,mpa

Yesterday was weird. I dropped below 150lbs and below 18.5 BMI, so officially underweight for the first time in my life.  I had planned to have a higher intake day because there was a new flavour of Doritos I wanted to try that I bought from work (Pepperoni Pizza). I did a shit ton of walking to compensate and net zero my calories for the day, then ate the bag + a Monster + some gummies.  But on my walk, the self-harm voice was crazy loud and I ended up punching my face out in public. Thankfully no one around to see what a freak I am but pretty sure I have some wicked bruising again.  I don't even know what happened after that because the day is kinda hazy but I ended up deciding to go buy myself ice cream to cheer myself up because of the SH. I thought 'fuck it, I'll have a write off day'. Which is whatever. I've kinda done that a couple times before. On the way I decided I'd get some Ben and Jerrys (pint party woo) and some Magnums too. And I did.  Got my family some presents while I was out too. When I got home I had two of the Magnums, and I enjoyed them even though they were melty. But I kinda spiralled then and essentially binged. Idk, I didn't necessarily feel out of control? I just thought, I'm gonna fuck this day and have whatever I want. Holiday chocolates, a meatball, ham, baked beans lol  I had my ice cream, it was dope. I loved it. In between food items though, I was self-harming by punching my face again. Not sure how much (if any) visible damage I've done but I'm gonna go check in the mirror in a moment. I guess I was punishing myself for not restricting?  Ended up with a net daily intake of almost 3000 calories. Even though I know I'll gain little to nothing from that, it still terrifies me. And now I'm planning on water fasting all week to compensate. Which also terrifies me.  I wanted to get better, or at least, not get worse and it feels like now my weight has dropped to where I wanted it to be...I'm kinda lost? I'm being torn between my body trying to gain back to safety and my warped mind trying to lose even more, even faster.  Anyway, I have work in a few and it's raining so much outside. I'm probably gonna have to take a change of clothes because my uniform will get soaked on the journey in. I'm also nervous about my shift, I've never water fasted before during work + the SH is probably visible.

Ive been medium restricting about 700-800 calories a day for 10 days and have only seen half a pound of weight loss, so I feel your pain. It sucks but you gotta have patience.

In South Africa which is my home country, it is a big compliment and it can be sensed from the way people say it that it is said with admiration or in the sense of 'you look good' - with the exception of my mom, from whom it is usually something more loaded. Even when I'm quite a bit underweight and thus objectively 'too' skinny, people will mean it as a compliment when they say it because it is idealized.  However, I found that in Serbia where my boyfriend lives, people are extremely free in commenting on the appearance of others; especially in the area where he lives, which is a largely agricultural area. Food and the culture of social eating is huge, and interpersonal boundaries with joking or commenting about appearance is not really a thing. And there, every time somebody has called me skinny (which happens a LOT, especially when I first came there because it was like my weight shocked people) - it has never been a compliment, but it has always been in the context of ""you'll look great if you gain 5 or 6kgs, you're too skinny, you should eat more, we'll fatten you right up"", etc. Needless to say this was a HUGE culture shock for me at the start and threw me right of balance. I'm more used to it now and not so bothered by it anymore, but at the beginning it was really confusing and triggering in so many ways.

I dunno maybe because I’m around cancer I look to that as an alternative, but in general I think people think cancer is this awful awful illness (and believe me it’s the fucking pits) but people are so much more understanding. Like if my patients are sad it’s like ofc you feel this way you’re dying you’ve got this horrific illness. Fine they deserve that sympathy, but I have a mental health condition and people scream at me if you loved me you’d get better. You’d never dream of saying that to someone with cancer. I think In general people are more understanding of physical illnesses because they can see it. Aside of the weight loss people can’t see anorexia. And in my family it’s not spoken about.

If I didn’t wake up tomorrow it would all be over. All the fighting over food and portions and my weight and my mother crying over my body would just be over. I get what you mean about it all being over. It’s so tiring to have to fight constantly - with YOURSELF, which is the saddest thing. I had a family member die from cancer and watched him suffer so badly from it. He said it was the worst thing he ever suffered - constant pain, plus the mental anguish of not knowing whether he would live or die and not being able to do anything except lie listlessly in the hospital. He didn’t have an ED but the cancer of course took a lot from him. EDs do take so much from us…and ruin so much. As someone who struggles with suicidal thoughts, I know the feeling of wanting to end it all….make the pain finally disappear. Hopefully you can find peace from this - please do seek help of some sort, it’s not good to be alone 🙏🏻",TRUE,0,0.00114744,0.2723269,0.08478592,0.11164863,0.28370225,0.001447143,0.045794718,0.0410617,0.040121447,0.11796383,mpa

I already have 2 vocational degrees in pharmacy and dietetics, so at least I dont feel like a complete failure.  Then he told me that if there was anything wrong health-related that I should tell them, because my mom told him im looking thinner, so for a moment I thought he was talking about the ED, but he said he doesnt think I lost weight, which I have. Im currently underweight and back to my ED habits. I mean it felt great being heard, loved and supported but I cant help but feel like shit because he doesnt notice my weight loss.

Some people still had their period being BMI 13-14 and other people lose it at a healthy weight. I personally lost it at BMI 18/19. I totally get why you don't want your period mine was horrible extremely painful and heavy always lasting 7 days and sometimes I wasn't able to leave the house because it was so bad. But that's not that common at all many people don't have issues with it at all. Also it's incredibly bad for your body not to have a period eventually your bones will suffer from it and you can get osteoporosis which is absolutely awful painful and you can break bones easily.

Technically, she doesn't even need your permission to use your posts in her research. People do research on internet communities all the time, and they don't always show up to clearly explain their research and give you the opportunity to opt out. What she has done is pretty much the height of ethical standards for research on internet communities and it's completely in line with the considerations made in this 2001 article. Here's a 2012 article about similar research on internet communities and how they handled the ethical issues. This article lays out what the generally-accepted ethical standards are in different countries. And here's another 2012 article that discusses how the issue has been handled in the past.  In case you don't want to read them, here's the high points:  1. You don't have to register for this website to access most of it. Some forums are only for registered members or members with a significant posting history, but not most of it. Therefore, most of this website is generally considered ""public space,"" comparable to a school bulletin board or observing crowd behavior at a sporting event.  2. Because EDs are considered ""sensitive subject matter,"" however, there's a higher expectation of privacy within the community even if it is technically a public space. This is because publicly discussing sensitive subject matter could potentially cause harm to the community participants. The 2001 article gives the example of forums for AIDS patients, which would require a higher consideration for privacy and informed consent.  3. Informed consent is not always required when doing research on internet communities, because of the risks it might pose to the research. People change their behavior when they know they're being observed. The issue of informed consent for internet communities is handled on a case-by-case basis, and it considers how sensitive the subject matter is, whether the research is focused on individuals or group behavior, and whether the research interacts with the community or passively observes it, among other things. Regardless, it is expected that researchers will carefully anonymize the data and control who has access to it.  4. ""Opt-out"" approaches to informed consent are considered appropriate.  5. The highest ethical standards include gaining approval from site owners/moderators, posting a clear explanation of what the research is, what data is being gathered and how it is being used, how the data will be anonymized and who will have access to it, and providing opportunities to opt in or out (depending on how the research is done) and ways to ask questions and contact the researchers directly.

It may be unlikely, but the fear is now there. It adds an extra layer of anxiety over coming here at all. That’s all it takes.  It’s conflicting needs. This person needs to do her research. We need to have a place to escape from the loneliness of the hell in which we are living. This community almost certainly saves lives. We go to some of the darkest places in our disorders, and having this place to come to and speak to people as screwed up as ourselves can honestly be lifesaving. And now some people are going to feel far more inhibited in doing this. Some people may stop coming altogether. It could mean the difference between life or death for someone.

I remember things through scent most of the time, and my shower water smelled like the inpatient shower the other night. I miss it. I miss the comfort and the lack of responsibilities and the cold and never having to eat bc I’m vegan and no one accommodates vegans around here (I was ip for depression).  Everything is linked to my ed thoughts. Every insecurity, every decision, every friend and reason why I’m friends with them…literally everything. My life has fallen apart due to my restriction. And no one has ever taken it seriously enough.  I was bad once. Like really bad, but I’ve never been hospitalized for my ed, so I feel that if I get that bad, people will finally understand just how badly I feel. But of course, insurance won’t cover it out-of-state unless it’s life-threatening, as if an ed is ever anything but life-threatening.  So I’m screwed. Idk what to do because I just want immediate help, but I will have to waste away my next year, probably trying to build up enough momentum to actually fall fully apart.

Then, on Friday, I had an appointment with my psychiatrist who obviously wasn't too happy about my weight loss. She told me I'd have to go inpatient if I lose lost another kilo. So I decided to maintain my weight and increased my calorie intake by 200-400calories. And I gained 0.3kg over the last three days!! I'm genuinely freaking out. How is this physically possible? This is what I have eaten:  Friday: 466kcal (= one thin crisp bread 22kcal, 80g plain pasta 288kcal, 150g of stir-fried vegetables 108kcal, 200g of raw vegetables 48kcal) • I lost 0.3kg on that day but it's probably important to mention that I had a bowel movement on that day. Saturday: 450kcal (= German bread roll 176kcal, 2 mini dumplings which were labelled 75kcal each =150kcal, 160g of raw vegetables 50kcal, 20g of Cornflakes without milk = 74kcal) • I gained 0.3kg, no bowel movement Sunday: 320kcal (= 2 mini dumplings 150kcal, 310g raw vegetables 96kcal, 20g Cornflakes without milk 74kcal) • I gained another 0.3kg, no bowel movement  How is it possible that I lost weight on Friday but gained on Saturday and Sunday where I ate even less calories than on Friday? This can't be just food weight, right? Will my weight drop again if I continue eating 300-500kcal a day? Is the weight gain just temporary or will I keep gaining weight? I'm desperate since I expected being able to eat 800kcal to maintain my weight. Is there any way to increase my metabolism?

I’m 40 years old so probably older than many of you. I had disordered eating in my teens and early 20s. In my late 20s I had a baby and maintained a “normal” weight for a while. Then my relationship turned abusive, then I was diagnosed with M.E & under active thyroid, then I was in yet another toxic relationship, then covid. And the weight went up and up and up. Almost a year ago, I went to Turkey for a gastric bypass. The op has saved my life!!! I’ve lost a lot of weight and now weigh 10sr3lbs and wear size 10 clothing. Before surgery, this is a what I wanted. Now I’m here, I want more. I want to look as delicate and pretty as I did when I was 23 and at my low weight. I have some diazepam, prescribed of course. I’m considering taking a week sick from work and basically sleeping through the day and night as a way to skip meals. Has anyone done this ?

Don't listen to that, IME that's totally psychological just like the idea that undereating alone leads to overeating later.  Try eating double because you fasted yesterday, not likely, even less likely if you don't want to.

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,binge/restrict cycle,1,TooTiReD2stop,2022-10-24 08:01:10-04:00,"I’m similar except it’s a restrict-binge-purge cycle for me. It was becoming really severe recently, but I have just managed to break it again, for now at least (not naive enough to think it will last forever, but this is the longest I’ve gone without binging and purging in ages and I’m feeling good right now). This is what has helped me to break the cycle:  1. Committed to weighing myself a maximum of once a week, no more, scales have been put away.  2. Taken myself out of the weight loss mindset and just focusing on not gaining any weight for now. Trying not to think about weight at all, just solely on eating behaviours. Weight loss can come later when I’ve fully regulated myself.  3. Become my own recovery dietician, giving myself daily meal plans in the way my dieticians used to do when I was in treatment. Except the calories are cut in half from that, because my internal dietician unfortunately still has an ED, lol. But I’m making myself eat significantly more than I was before. High restriction. Aiming for about 1,000 kcal a day but sometimes it ends up lower and other times higher. (I’ll revisit the flexibility point in a minute)  4. This meal plan consists of six, yes SIX, eating occasions per day. Three meals and three snacks, as you’ll get in recovery. Outside of the overnight fast, I am not allowing myself to go longer than 3 hours without eating something. This is really really challenging, as I almost never feel like eating so soon, and the urge to restrict is overwhelmingly strong. It’s also a real head fuck knowing that many normies won’t eat as many as six times a day. But I have to stick to it, because if I go down the restriction path, then the next time I do eat will result in reactive eating and put me at high risk of a binge.  5. Crucially, my meal plan is pitched so that it’s not completely optional, nor is it a set of rigid rules. This is the hardest part: too flexible = will lead to heavier restriction and then a binge, so it’s important to have some rules, whereas too rigid = allows no room to change my plan based on what I’m fancying or what’s available, and when any reactive eating occurs, this would lead to that “fuck it, I’ve ruined it now” response that also leads to a binge.  To demonstrate, this happened just today. I was really craving a different lunch than what I’d planned. What I wanted was healthy and protein packed, but it was 75 kcal higher than what I’d planned to have (275 instead of 200). I decided to listen to my body and have the food I wanted.  When I finished, I was still really hungry and not yet satiated. I waited for a while, had a drink, had a vape, did something to distract myself. But the desire for more food wouldn’t go away, so within the next 15 minutes I had 2 snacks - a dessert & a savoury - which between them amounted to an extra 160 kcal.  At this stage my brain was sounding alarm bells and I came close to binging and purging. But logically, I knew I’d probably end up consuming more calories after a binge & purge, and I actually found that the second snack finally satiated me. I had planned about 150 kcal for my afternoon snack anyway, and all I had done was front-load it into lunch.  Later on, I feel absolutely fine, and I’m so satiated now that I don’t feel the need for a ‘proper’ afternoon snack. However, this will mean going longer than 3 hours before eating again, so I plan on listening to my body, and if I become starving before dinner, then I will give my body what it needs. I know that I underate yesterday and didn’t have everything I was planning to have, so this is my body’s way of regulating itself. I’m still on track to have no more than 1,100 calories overall today, which is a lot more than yesterday, and I know I won’t gain fat on that intake.  This is the kind of flexibility I’m talking about. Just enough that you can retain an element of freedom and responsiveness, but not so much that you have no accountability to yourself.  6. Lastly, I am logging everything I eat. Even when I’m embarrassed about what I’ve eaten (I mean, nobody else is looking at this after all), it’s all still going on the log. This is not to pressure or shame myself, but because it is helping me to identify patterns. From my log, I can see that when I eat under 800 calories in a day, I’m far more likely to reactively eat the next day, and I can see the kinds of foods that really satiate me versus the ones that leave me wanting more. It also helps me identify when I’m most likely to be hungry. From my log, I can see that most days, I’m never hungry at morning snack time and I just need a little something to tide me over - usually 50 kcal’s worth of popcorn or fruit. Whereas afternoon snack time I’m more likely to want something substantial, for some reason. So I plan my calories that way. But that will look different for everyone.  I hope that helps a bit. Needless to say, I would have a much higher chance of success if I increased my intake even further - if I could do 1,500 calories that would be so much better, and I’d be much less likely to binge as you could eat some really good meals for that, so if you can go higher at all I’d recommend that.",FALSE,0,0.005646176,0.056906186,0.019992502,0.15176502,0.13093747,0.000461404,0.3455017,0.16270132,0.003991678,0.12209657,mpa

I do get some energy in the mornings from it which is nice! its not life changing coffee replacement, but it's good to have nutritional insurance. If your body isnt defficent in a vitimin or nutrient, you wont absorb it and you'll just pee it out. HOWEVER, if you have an ED, good chance you are in-fact deficient. The price is very high though, so it would be cheaper to go to a doctor, get full labs done, find out what you ACTUALLY need and then take specific supplements. I, however, am lazy.  I had a subscription, but put it on pause because I wasn't scheduled enough to get through the bag per month and it is pricey. Its not snake oil though, which is nice. It's a legit product that I first heard about from a non sponsored neuro scientist who has been taking it for years, and i do trust the research behind the bio availability of the nutrients. I'm sure they do pay people for reviews, as thats what almost all companies do. I know lots of people who are on it just because they like it and it makes them feel good.Thanks for reminding me I have it in my fridge. I'm going to add that in my meal plan and see if it helps me reduce / replace my normal sugar alcohol filled Quest bar for breakfasts. I don't know why I didn't think of using it as a weight loss / appetite suppressant.  Second, You're a dirty fucking liar.

Any help or insight is appreciated. Not being able to workout and feeling short of breath absolutely make sense with severe anemia.  It's dangerous to overdose on iron, but if you ask your doctor, you might be able to take an even higher dose than what they originally gave you (unless they already gave you the maximum non-lethal dose for your size). I think you're supposed to avoid consuming certain things like calcium and milk at the same time as your pills and drinking orange juice when taking them helps absorption. Maybe ask how long after taking the iron you have to wait before you can consume calcium.  If you get nauseated I would check with someone before loading up on tums because they might interfere with your absorption. (I think tums are mostly calcium.)  Check with your doctor to see if it's okay to use your calories for the day for high-iron items (ex. Spinach and red meat, I think).  Divide the percent iron on the nutrition label by the number of calories: the highest numbers should mark the foods that are good sources of iron. (You don't have to adjust those values for the amount of that food you eat becauee you're looking for the best source of iron, not exact amounts that you personally consumed.As long as the calories and percent iron are based on the same serving size, they'll work.)  Tell your doctor about any multivitamins you are taking because the amount of iron it it might cross you over the safety limit of iron intake.  Maybe talk to your doctor about TOM if necessary, if it's causing excessive blood loss.  Exercise can, I believe, ""use up"" your iron prematurely.

I do not think she has long if she continues to engage in her disorder, which is really heartbreaking, but it's the reality of anorexia. I hate when I see people passing judgement on her, because she clearly is not thinking. My mother is very emotionally and mentally stunted because of her disorder. She is not stupid, but she can't hold a job, is constantly in and out of hospitals, and loses track of seemingly small things. Important things, too, which is probably more damaging to her self esteem as it is. My mother has only lived this long because of her bouts of recovery (where she gains back 40-60lbs, but then relapses again and loses it.) I cannot be around my mother anymore as she does not treat me well, and it really breaks my heart because I never had a real mom throughout my childhood due to her disorder. I honestly think Eugenia deals with the same issues mentally and just cannot get over it. My mom already is dealing with brain complications (seizures and heart problems) and she has recovered NUMEROUS times. Eugenia has only attempted it once, and didn't weight restore. She does not have time. She is probably going to die soon. Anorexia is a terrible disease that I also struggle with, because of how impressionable and seductive it is at first...

So never going below BMI 13 again I'm actually doing quite well/ okay mentally and I know if I start losing weight again I'll just spiral again want to get a life finally and want to get my passion for drawing back to have enough energy to go on my walks to get grocery hauls (food hoarder here haha) for my mom.

Especially when driving, I'm terrified of that. I can maybe deal with hunger pains, but when it comes to hunger induced nausea I draw the line. Puking uncontrollably on an empty stomach is torture. Years and years of therapy have convinced me that I need at least SOME food to stay alive and be functional. The amount I'm actually eating though is way less than what is considered the bare minimum. Some days are worse than others but leaning on some safe foods helps a bit. I don't want to drop too low, because I know I will like it (stupid AN brain) and keep going at it until I lose everything and die. Like, I know I am underweight, but I try to be... not TOO underweight? I don't make much sense right now, don't I? Anyway, you get the picture. I actually like food. Shocker, I know lol.

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,What do you do after hitting your UGW,1,bluedays,2022-10-18 14:58:17-04:00,"short answer: i’d recommend learning how to maintain that lw for at least six months before trying to go lower. Long answer: you will wake up one morning and you’ll be at your lowest weight, and you will be happy for maybe five minutes. And then that’s it. There isn’t a magical feeling besides the self satisfaction that you were able to do it. Now this is where it gets tricky. If you continue to lower your ugw, you run the very high chance of starting a binge cycle. You might not go all the way back to your hw, but you’ll go back to a point that you wish you had appreciated that lw, only it will be much harder to lose. OR, you immediately start eating at “maintenance” for your new lw, but will ignore the fact that after an extreme diet, or starvation, your body will hold on to excess weight until it’s sure you won’t starve anymore. My advice: once you hit your ugw, appreciate it. Slowly incorporate more calories every few days, slow enough that you can monitor any binge feelings. Once you start maintaining, your body will normally add around five pounds of water weight back on. Please understand this is completely normal! After six months or so you should be comfortable and maintaining this low weight, and then you can reassess if you’re happy or want to go lower",FALSE,0,0.001339732,0.021470338,0.015202849,0.25926957,0.0476431,0.001689661,0.22749831,0.07372506,0.001726482,0.3504349,mpa

I am nearly 40 and walk the bulldog over the fields (up and down, little hills, roads covered with stones) 90 min Mo-Fr Sat and Sun I am usually in an indoor pool with the kids or playground, so active and moving around but not doing ""real cardio"" or something. Stay at home mom with two kids and husband, housework is all my job. Grocery too. Basically everything.  I don´t know my TDEE but I binge quite often on frozen food (bread) and I would say my daily average intake is therefore 1900-2000.  Due to a surgery I am always constipated so I don´t step on the scale but I can see (and feel with clothes) that I am losing slowly. Guess TDEE is therefore 2200-2400.  Problem is, that I am dizzy all the time. Worse than in my low res teenage years. Get up? Almost faint. My head is turning around.  I try to eat healthy-balanced, almost no sugar, maybe 2-3 gummibears a day. Only sugar free bread, so no hidden stuff. I am a bit orthorexic, so really no junk, no bs food and I try to add fats and seeds and I definitely have enough protein.  I cannot see a doctor at the moment due to other shit going on in my life but the last blood results were okayish - nothing to worry about. Due to an accident and weight gain I carry about 6-8 kgs excess skin that will be removed in the next weeks and months.  So weight therefore is without it about 52-56 kgs, height is in the mornings 167. I am large framed and can see my ripcage, spine. Knees hurt at night, even rips, sometimes shoulder. I hate my bone structure, I want to be a ballerina but I am a cowgirl.  I don´t understand it. I want to go back so desperately to 47, but could mentally handle 52, even 56 would be the magical border but 52 would be okay-ish and safe.  My doctor told me that 55 is the border for me otherwise I would start to become severe underweight. I think they measure BMI different in older adults, underweight for me starts at 58 kgs and I know I have less after the skin removal surgery but it seems so high.  To keep my active lifestyle I would have to eat 2100 to maintain 58 kgs. and I guess due to my binges (it´s not a real binge, more reactive eating) I reach that daily and I feel nothing but guilt and shame.  Any advice for this sad mom here? I take my daily suppl..   XOXO Orio",FALSE,0,0.037647016,0.08235789,0.005010827,0.12991044,0.08995751,0.08947986,0.23712482,0.09750518,0.000987871,0.23001863,mpa

MyProAna,Anorexia Discussions,Could anyone help me ?,1,EzraPez,2022-10-29 08:23:55-04:00,"Hi, I've struggled with binge/restricting cycles basically since I was young. If you try to restrict, you WILL end up in another binging phase. This happened to me; I restricted for a long time, and one day I just began binging. Since last year I've been on very short restriction phases followed by huge binges. Right now you really need to focus on taking care of yourself, trying to restrict right now will just make it worse.  I understand that's hard to hear but I'm not saying you can't diet; just try not to count calories or actively restrict yourself. If you want some chocolate? Have some chocolate. But that's the key; some. Try to focus on protein so you will feel fuller, don't eat takeout and try to cook your own meals. If your diet consists of lots of fats, try to cut down, but don't completely exclude. The second thing is make sure you're exercising; go on long walks, bike rides, swim, because it'll make you feel good and it'll also help with weight loss. My third tip would to be don't buy your usual binge foods; the amount of times I tell myself I'll buy this multipack of something and won't end up eating the whole thing is the entire problem. If you have no binge foods in your house you're much less likely to binge.  And as for your emotions; try to find a hobby or something to distract yourself from eating. Try drawing, reading, writing, play games, going on walks, talk to your friends or family. Maybe even see a therapist if that is available for you, if not there are a lot of self-help tips online.  I know this is all easier said than done - but if you try to actively restrict you'll most likely end up in a binging cycle. Like you just said it took you months to get up to this weight, losing quickly with restricting just isn't an option for you when you're stuck in a cycle like this. Think about the long term; in a year do you really want to be starting all over again and recovering from another binge/restricting cycle or do you want to have made it down to the weight at a slower pace but have that be a sustainable weight loss.",FALSE,0,0.0666583,0.036516227,0.16813178,0.09303126,0.00171669,0.00114902,0.16347198,0.28244218,0.00117406,0.18570848,mpa

I agree that education on nutrition is lacking in every field (besides nutritionists and perhaps personal trainers) but if you look at things from a different perspective maybe your mindset/opinion on physians will change.  Nutritionists go through an adequate amount of schooling to become masters in their field (nutrition). Physicians (psychs included) go through extensive schooling to learn a little to a lot about many aspects of medicine as a whole. It's only if they are able to do a fellowship that they specialize in their field. Physicians know this, and the decent ones shouldn't be claiming to be nutrition experts, but they are in fact the most qualified to create a healthcare plan for EDs, which are much more a health issue and not so much a focused nutrition issue. Physicians have the knowledge to connect your brain, cognition, organ systems, pathology, and nutrition, all together...which makes them the best suited (knowledge wise) to treat their patients.

Yeah that part was harsh, but most likely just got off a shift and might've been a bit emotional. As I see it, they're more mad about the fact that people who are mostly bed-bound tend to be much ruder and demanding to the staff and don't make an effort to change themselves.

Said people often never make an effort to lose the weight with the mindset of ""Well people are taking care of me so why should I?"" And I've hear quite often of these people yelling and cursing out the nurses due to overall stupid reasons that they have no control of.

Yes because any time that you are consistently at the same caloric intake and output, you are going to reach a plateau so you will need to either increase your activity or vary up your calories (or you could do both).  For example, let's say you were on a ""normal"" diet and your maintenance cals were 1800. You needed a deficit of 300-500 calories per day to lose weight at a moderate pace. Then you would do a schedule like:  Monday - 1400 cals Tuesday - 1400 cals Wednesday - 1600 cals Thursday - 1450 cals Friday - 1500 cals Saturday - 1425 cals Sunday - 1400 cals  So it's like a random pattern but 5 days out of the week you are reaching that larger deficit. You can do this through exercise as well so let's say you ate 1800 cals today. As long as you burn off 400 cals, you are in your deficit (of your maintenance) but you need to vary your exercise otherwise your body will get used to it and you will again reach a plateau after initially losing.  That's why hiit training is so popular. Because instead of 30-60 minutes of moderate paced walking, you are doing 15-20 minutes of 30-60 second intervals in terms of pacing and exertion. It actually gets your heart rate to stay up the entire time, even though you are not working hard the entire time and even though you burn less calories in that 15-20 minutes than the 60 minutes, you will light a fire under your metabolism to burn more calories in general throughout the day.  When your body goes into starvation mode, it freaks out and your hormones become imbalanced. That's why body builders have ""off seasons"" and ""on seasons"" because no one can physically manage to keep their body fat that low (competition worthy) all year round.

Multiple things crossed my mind: depression, the body simply being fed up with the abuse you're giving it, simply the ins and outs of an ED which has phases... also the worrisome use of ""motivation to do it"".

(non intentionally) i started throwing up orange stuff which i think was bile and literally couldn’t keep water down and i felt like i was dying. basically all the dr said was to have liquids like smoothies and milkshakes etc for a little while. no one told them about the not eating and they just thought i had some sort of stomach bug or something. i kind of took it a little to literal and started only having smoothies and protein shakes, and then switched to just protein shakes because i was and still am afraid that the carbs and sugar would trigger an insulin response and cause hunger cues. (i had lost them completely) so for most of this past year i’ve been living solely off of 160 calorie bottled premier protein shakes. at one point right before i was admitted to the medical hospital for electrolytes and stuff i was living off of one a day for a while. when i was admitted then i was around bmi 15. i was only there for a week and it wasn’t too bad because they started me off on a pretty small meal plan because i was at risk of refeeding syndrome. they wanted to put me in treatment then but my insurance didn’t cover it back then. after that i maintained around like 80-88 for a while living on liquids. and then i kid you not,, i just woke up and started binging like crazy. it got so bad that i started screaming one night and the cops got called. i was taken to the hospital and then a psychiatric hospital. i was there for a week ish and didn’t eat while i was there. i had went from 79 to like 90 from binging and like a week after the hospital i was back at like 80. i went back to liquids for a month and a half after that. i was so scared that even a bite of food would cause me to binge. i was basically so scared of binging that i just didn’t eat anything. my metabolism stopped and i was around 80 but then from some days walking doing errands and metabolism boost from trying to increase my intake in liquid i was down to 76 at my lowest and started binging a ton again. my mom got threatened to have social services called if i didn’t get treatment after i was in a different psychiatric hospital and they found this loophole in the insurance where if they switched me to a different kind of insurance within the same insurance it would be covered. we had went to the city where the clinic was which is only like 2 hours away and i used to live there and stayed with my grandparents until i could go into treatment. the waiting list was pretty far away but when i got interviewed by admissions i was bumped up a ton and got to like a 1-2 week wait. (i kind of traumatized that lady by how crazy i acted on the phone lmao) when i got at their house i was back at like 76 from some restriction after binging but i still had really bad urges. I kind of just thought fuck it idc anymore and went on literally the biggest binge spree you could imagine. (i didn’t really purge back then) like i’m talking almost a dozen donuts, loaves of bread, cereal, peanut butter, cookies literally anything i could find. one of the days me and my mom actually got in a fight and she slapped money on the table cuz i was begging for binge food and i walked to the store from my grandparents house and bout like a loaf of bread, margarine, half a dozen krispy kreme’s, and like 3-4 grocery store bakery donuts and was spreading butter on to bread with my fingers and literally inhaling donuts as i was walking home. i can’t imagine what the people who saw though when they saw this super skinny girl just stuffing her face on the sidewalk lol. anyhoo in like a week and a half i had went from 76 to 98 when i was weighed the next day when i got to treatment. but the next day the water weight went down and i was like 91. but still that’s like 15 pounds in a short period of time. so to sum it all up treatment sucked and i went from 91 to 120 in two months but they wanted to keep me longer and get me to their goal of 140-150 😃 (i’m 5’4) because i used to be overweight. but my school was starting so they let me out with a weight gain meal plan??? they want me to gain the weight at home but i haven’t been following it obviously. the highest my mealplan got in res was 4400. i was on “super snacks” (more high calorie snacks) an add on, and 100 % on meals. the super snacks were things like ben and jerry’s, a bagel with a shit ton of pb honey and bananas on it, pb&j ON BANANA BREAD and stuff like that which i had 3 of the super snacks a day. basically a super snack is equivalent to 2 add ons and an add on is around 200 calories, and each ss is like 500-600 calories. keep in mind a 100 % meal plan is 3000 calories without anything extra. it was a lot of food even for me to be honest which is saying a lot. res sucked so horribly. i’m not saying to not get help because there are really great resources out there just my experience in res wasn’t the best. basically since i got out in august it’s been a binge restrict (sometimes purge???) cycle and i’ve fluctuated from like 125 to like 108 since. it’s been such a nightmare. i’ve actually had to switch from in person to online school because i’ve missed so many days and i’m miserable. the only thing that gives me hope is I’ve gotten a psychiatrist to put me back on my adhd meds. (taken off of my first hospitalization) what’s good is it’s vyvanse which is actually prescribed for BED and 50 mg which is HIGH. also, there is a small chance i might be able to also get concerta (another stimulant) because of a typo in a med list if the insurance is really stupid. i quite literally can’t even eat a single bite of solid food even if it’s healthy without turning into a binge. only when i’m fasting or living on liquids i don’t binge but i’m in a cycle where i go a couple days and then binge. anyways, that was super long and a huge rant but if anyone actually reads this and has any advice at all please reply to this.",FALSE,0,0.14138058,0.13617085,0.015264023,0.041960493,0.03949714,0.016478134,0.16568722,0.018058518,0.04336224,0.38214082,mpa

If you get a shaken espresso, they use half pumps but say full pumps on the app so keep that in mind if you order those a lot like me. There is 150 calories in a venti unsweetened matcha almond milk latte. So I would guess 220cals.

People around you sound nice so this may not sound relatable but I know what you mean. I got I’ll because of this illness and had to move in with my sister who promised she’d take care of me. Ended up replacing her for her cat as a care giver, cleaning her apartment every god given day, cooking for her, doing groceries for her, and supporting her emotionally fully for her classes and social life.. what she did as a support system during my recovery attempt tho was first to blame me for being a selfish addict, then making up for it by convincing me she struggles to express her worry for me, and when I tried to recover sleep/eat along would be unbearable especially during refeeding .. she would get pissed when I got anxious about calories or anything in general. But what got me the most was I once read her diary(I was high and an idiot) and she wrote there that I was manic most of the time and always hurtful no matter what she does to make me happy. Cuz she is an innocent angel omg. She makes sacrifices for me, being kind to me but me oh noo I’m mentally ill and selfish and can’t even eat a fucking banana. Even in her mind she doesn’t acknowledge my efforts for her and justifies her own ignorance towards my situation. My parents blamed me for being a fucking failure just two days ago too yeap. Of course that happens in life. It’s just that I’ve been so ill, physically I mean - and ppl are such brutes. My entire Ed experience has been keep realizing that I’m on my own. Starving? Nobody cares. Suicide? Oh god you can’t even make that right. Binge? You’re getting better finally. Who knows maybe your existence will be of some use now don’t forget to eat pizza too haha(!). I’m moving back to my town now -where I have my school, goals, and solitude. Decided to feed myself I guess (doesn’t mean weight gain but spiritually/financially/mentally supporting myself no matter what)- cuz nobody is going to do that for me or give a fuck they made it quite obvious so far. Life is mean, and I’m sorry. I hope you’ll feel better soon. Please avoid self harm you’re important. At the end of the day, you’re on your own and need to help yourself.

I recently watched a super triggering movie, which I wasn’t expecting to be triggering. however, I watched it last night and I’m still depressed. BUT, the weird thing is, I never went through the trauma depicted in the movie. and yet it still impacts me. I feel like a fucking phony because I have no reason to be feeling this way, yet I’m still in a trance. I don’t feel real. I feel like shutting down.  sure, my childhood wasn’t the best. constant criticism and falling victim to my mother’s favoritism of my sibling. emotional abuse rarely turned physical and I am so physically healed from this time period… I no longer live at home, and only go home when I want to. but, why do I still feel like some super traumatic event happened in my childhood and I just can’t remember it?? I lost a lot of memories from when I was younger (like there are years where I remember super little, if any, of what happened), so I’m constantly second guessing my reality. why do I feel like I’ve been through a trauma I don’t know about? part of the emotional abuse I went through involved a lot of gaslighting (didn’t know what was real or fake for a while because of it). maybe that’s why I feel this way?  this triggers my anorexia, as well. one of the most traumatic experiences of my life was being in residential and inpatient facilities. so, whenever I watch something that triggers that feeling of going through something traumatic, I am transported back to the feeling of cowering in my room as a child, feeling completely alone in my own family, or back to inpatient, feeling completely belittled and abused by staff.  the weird thing is, I almost wanted to be anorexic when I was a kid. I’ve struggled with disordered thoughts and eating since I was a child. my mom always commented on her body, and my body looked a lot like hers. she was also always dieting, which quickly rubbed off on me. I would have breakdowns about getting taller than my mom, and would restrict to make sure I stayed petite. I wished someone noticed so badly that I had disordered thoughts and eating, that when I finally got the anorexia diagnosis, I almost felt accomplished. so, I know that I’m a little messed up in the head. however, why the heck do I feel like I’m in an episode when I’m triggered. I don’t know how else to explain it, other than feeling like I’m no longer where I am.  does anyone have any advice? how do I get out of this trance? why do I feel like this?  thank you xx  p.s., if it helps, I’m diagnosed with anorexia, anxiety, adhd, and depression",FALSE,0,0.000744608,0.06925056,0.05860246,0.000805136,0.19843225,0.011686143,0.001058763,0.16277544,0.23381227,0.2628324,mpa

I tried not to finish my meals, but because I was gaining, my family didn’t really react too much. But because I found out about the weight gain, I got very depressed and I became more stubborn about not eating. I’m not sure how much I weigh now, but this past Monday I weighed 89.0 lbs. I’m guessing I lost more because my family kept weighing me and even tried a different scale because they wanted to make sure the reading was accurate. The Equip team also informed my parents today that I’m not allowed to walk too much because I shouldn’t be burning any extra calories. If I want to go outside, I have to be in a wheelchair or eat more so I can earn the privilege of walking. I feel very agitated atm and I feel the depression creeping up. I don’t want to recover. I don’t want to gain weight. I don’t even really want to live anymore. I hope I can try to restrict to at least below 1100 tomorrow (and I hate even eating over 800), but I’m not sure because I can do that since my family made it clear that if I refuse to eat they will admit me to an inpatient facility.

Don't get on my ass about an-dx stuff etc. I have enough of that where I live thanks)  I am in my 30s. I am a qualified occupational therapist. I qualified in 2019 after taking 5 years to complete the 3 year degree due to being in hosp cos of losing too much weight etc etc.  I haven't worked since I qualified because covid happened and there was a massive lack of jobs and then my mental health.  I follow (and they follow me back) some people who I went to uni with my first years (2014) and I am beyond jealous. They're all still friends. They look happy. One is now a band 7 (u start band 5 UK) and she's a bit younger than me.  They just posted sharing food and drinking and having fun last night ( and they're mainly small and slim too)  I was sat at home sad. Alone. Working out if I am actually gonna be able to end my fast Nov 1st and eat during that month but still lose. Panicking about having an ed referral because I am 'anorexic' and 'really unwell' etc (I am told this. I don't agree).  I feel so bad that I'm jealous. It's stupid. It's not even 6am and I've been up body checking, scared to weigh, crying, planning my day so I can get 40,000 steps in instead of the 23,000/25,000 I have been getting in.  How can I lose this last 30lbs? Etc etc etc.  My life literally has turned to shit. And I don't remember when that happened?  I DO do things to pull myself around. I get up. Clean my house daily. Take care of my animals. Do my garden. Do my makeup etc etc. But none of that seems to matter anymore.  I wish I hadn't screwed up. Or I at least wish I was small now so I can be at least worth it a bit.  Sorry this is so long. I don't really know what response I'm expecting. Please do hate. Really can't right now.

I don't have any words of wisdom right now, but I have a similar experience and just want you to know that you're not alone in this. I was on an integrated masters degree for nursing, and I had to drop out during my first year because my disordered eating turned into way more than that. I won't bore you with the details, but it's so hard to see my coursemates being successful. I'm proud of them, of course. But the girls I would hang out with and attend lectures with are all in really fucking great jobs, climbing the bands, earning money, and they're all still friends. They look so happy. I ended up on a music degree instead (which I finally finished in June), but now I'm jobless, mostly miserable, and obsessed with shrinking. Having that control over my body and my weight brings me comfort at a time where I feel I have no direction and everything's a mess. Not knowing when your life went to shit is truly hard, and I completely empathise with you on that. Functioning and getting the daily things done, and feeling like none of it matters? It's tough. But I think it's completely understandable that you feel like that given the circumstances.  One thing I will say is this: don't feel bad about feeling jealous. The fact that you're uncomfortable with that feeling means that it conflicts with your morals, and so just by that, I can tell you right now that you're a good person. You didn't screw up, this isn't your fault, and you didn't choose this. If you did, it would be easy to just stop. You wouldn't have typed out this post if it were as simple as that.  I know it feels impossible, and I hate when I'm given this advice, but please try and recognise how much you've achieved in spite of your circumstances. There are so many people that carry far less burden who work towards nothing. You fucking did it when you could've just given up. If you can't have compassion towards yourself right now because it feels like too much, try and reflect on the past versions of you who got you here and persisted with the degree despite everything. You have done incredibly well, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.  As for feeling like you're never going to be happy, again, I totally get it. I'm right there with you. However... It's impossible to stay unhappy forever - literally nothing stays the same forever. It's the laws of physics/nature/life. Things are constantly changing, and they will for you. And you deserve that. It's going to be ok. It'll take a while for you to believe that, but just take it one day at a time. Baby steps, yeah? I don't know you, but I'm really proud of you.

It’s easy for me to say not to get into it as I have never felt the need. I know people feel that your connected with others but really are a lot of those connections important to you? Would you ever pick up the phone and ask to go for a cup of coffee with any of these people?  The reality is that you probably have little in common with them and you don’t need a window into their lives. It’s all probably fake.
